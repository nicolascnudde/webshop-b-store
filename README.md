## Webshop

For our final project for @Work-2, we were put in groups of 2 to create a webshop where we would offer products from various categories. We decided to go with an online bicycle store.

I was mostly doing the back-end of this application, where I created the database and wrote a seeder to fill it with both real & fictional data (fakerjs), wrote the models and controllers, created the endpoints for the API, then tested them with Postman and finally documented them with Swagger, and added authentication.
